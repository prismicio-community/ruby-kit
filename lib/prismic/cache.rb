module Prismic
  # This is a simple cache class provided with the prismic.io Ruby kit.
  # It is pretty dumb but effective:
  #  * everything is stored in memory,
  #  * invalidation: not needed for prismic.io documents (they are eternally immutable), but we don't want the cache to expand indefinitely; therefore all cache but the new master ref is cleared when a new master ref gets published.
  #
  # If you need a smarter caching (for instance, caching in files), you can extend this class and replace its methods,
  # and when creating your API object like this for instance: Prismic.api(url, options), pass the name of the class you created
  # as a :cache_class option.
  # Therefore, to use this simple cache, you can create your API object like this: Prismic.api(url, {cache_class: Prismic::Cache})
  class Cache

    # Returns the cache object holding the responses to "results" queries (lists of documents).
    # This is a Hash in a Hash: keys in the outer Hash are the refs (so that it's easy to invalidate entire refs at once);
    # keys in the inner Hash are the query strings (URLs) of each query.
    # The object that is stored as a cache_object is what is returned by Prismic::JsonParser::results_parser
    # (so that we don't have to parse anything again, it's stored already parsed).
