```

#### Kit Documentation

You should check out [the "Kits and helpers" section of our API documentation](https://developers.prismic.io/documentation/UjBe8bGIJ3EKtgBZ/api-documentation#kits-and-helpers), which sets general information about how our kits work. The Ruby kit is mostly compliant with it, but contains some mild differences:

 * The api object's type is Prismic::API, and the name of the method to retrieve the master ref is gotten by `api.master_ref`.
 * There's no `ctx` object to pass around; the context is passed in different ways.
 * From the api object, getting a form is done through the `create_search_form` method; a basic querying therefore looks like this: `api.create_search_form("everything").query("[[:d = at(document.type, \"product\")]]").submit(ref)`
 * Accessing type-dependent fields from a `document` is done through a `fragments` hash. Printing the HTML version of a field therefore looks like `document.fragments["title_user_friendly"].as_html(link_resolver(ref)).html_safe`.

#### Use it

You can look at the [rails starter](https://github.com/prismicio/ruby-rails-starter) project to see how to use it :-)
